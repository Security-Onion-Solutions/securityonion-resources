  Summary: This rule detects various execution patterns of the CrackMapExec pentesting
    framework, specifically looking for command line activities that suggest remote
    command execution, fileless output redirection to network shares or temporary
    directories, and obfuscated or non-obfuscated PowerShell commands. Key indicators
    include specific command line arguments used with `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`,
    which are characteristic of CrackMapExec's operation for performing remote code
    execution and evading detection. The detections leveraged include patterns like
    silent command execution and manipulating output redirection, typically associated
    with malicious administrative tasks on Windows systems.

  Summary: This rule detects the use of Impacket's SecretDump tool for remote Activity
    Directory credential dumping on Windows systems. It identifies suspicious access
    to the administrative shares (\\\\\*\\ADMIN\$) coupled with temporary files and
    SYSTEM32 directory references. This activity is indicative of an attempt to access
    and extract credential data, which is a known tactic of the SecretDump tool. The
    detection relies on specific event logs that indicate file share access attempts
    and requires the audit policy for detailed file sharing to be configured for both
    success and failure events.

  Summary: This rule detects the execution of shell processes when the parent process
    is located in the temporary (/tmp) directory. It monitors for the initiation of
    various shells, including bash, csh, dash, fish, ksh, sh, and zsh, by verifying
    if the parent process image path starts with '/tmp/'. This behavior could indicate
    the presence of malware such as the GobRAT, which is known to use the /tmp directory
    for malicious activities.

  Summary: This rule detects attempts to disable Symantec Endpoint Protection through
    the misuse of the taskkill command. Specifically, it identifies instances where
    the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM user executes the taskkill command to forcefully terminate
    the 'ccSvcHst.exe' process, which is essential for the antivirus service. This
    action effectively shuts down Symantec Endpoint Protection, exploiting a vulnerability
    in the implementation of its protected service mechanism.

  Summary: This rule detects the execution of Rundll32.exe when DLL files are cloaked
    as image files. It identifies instances where the process creation log involves
    Rundll32.exe and the associated DLL files have misleading image file extensions
    such as .bmp, .cr2, .eps, .gif, .ico, .jpeg, .jpg, .nef, .orf, .png, .raw, .sr2,
    .tif, or .tiff. This behavior can indicate an attempt to evade defenses by using
    legitimate processes to run malicious code, leveraging the common practice of
    masquerading DLL files as images.

  Summary: This rule detects potential command line obfuscation using Unicode characters
    from a suspicious image. Adversaries may use this technique to make an executable
    or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise
    obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. Specifically, it monitors
    for processes created by common command line tools such as `cmd.exe`, `cscript.exe`,
    `powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`, and `wscript.exe`, and checks for the presence of
    unusual Unicode characters in the command line arguments, which can include various
    spacing modifier letters, alternative characters for the forward slash and hyphen,
    and other special symbols.

  Summary: This rule detects instances where child processes are created with SYSTEM
    level privileges by parent processes running under LOCAL SERVICE or NETWORK SERVICE
    accounts. This is often indicative of a privilege escalation attempt. Specifically,
    the rule monitors process creation events for signs that the originating process
    has a lower privilege level, such as LOCAL SERVICE or NETWORK SERVICE, and the
    resulting process is elevated to SYSTEM level. This behavior can be exploited
    by various tools and methods as part of a privilege escalation attack. The rule

  Summary: This rule detects the creation of a custom protocol handler named "rogue"
    in the Windows registry. This activity is associated with the Forest Blizzard
    APT group and has been reported by Microsoft. The creation of such protocol handlers
    indicates an attempt to establish persistence mechanisms by defining how certain
    URLs (under the custom protocol "rogue") should be processed by the operating
    system. The specific details in the registry include a target object containing
    '\PROTOCOLS\\Handler\rogue\CLSID' and a particular CLSID value, which aligns with
    the behavior observed in post-compromise tools employed by this APT to exploit
    vulnerabilities and obtain credentials.

  Summary: This rule detects the persistence activity of the Kapeka backdoor on Windows
    systems. Kapeka uses different methods to achieve persistence based on the user's
    privileges. If the Kapeka dropper operates with administrator or SYSTEM privileges,
    it creates a scheduled task named "Sens Api" using the schtasks command to run
    upon system startup. If the dropper operates without these privileges, it sets
    persistence through an autorun registry entry called "Sens Api" under HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
    using the "reg add" command. In both methods, the created task or registry entry
    launches the backdoor's binary via rundll32, invoking the first export ordinal
    of the backdoor without any additional argument. This facilitates the continuous
    execution of the backdoor, ensuring it reactivates with system or user logins.

  Summary: This rule detects potential sideloading of the "mpclient.dll" library by
    observing the execution of Windows Defender processes, specifically "MpCmdRun.exe"
    and "NisSrv.exe", from non-default directories. This behavior may indicate an
    attempt to exploit these processes for malicious purposes, as legitimate executions
    typically occur only from specific default directories associated with Windows
    Defender. Detecting these occurrences can help identify attempts to evade defenses
    by leveraging trusted Windows Defender files.

  Summary: This rule detects potential DLL sideloading activities where DLL files
    known to be commonly abused are loaded from suspicious locations on a Windows
    system. It focuses on specific DLLs such as 'coreclr.dll', 'facesdk.dll', 'HPCustPartUI.dll',
    'libcef.dll', and 'ZIPDLL.dll' being loaded from directories that are typically
    uncommon for legitimate application activity. These directories include performance
    logs, public user folders, temporary internet files, Windows temporary directories,
    and specific subfolders within individual user directories like 'Favorites', 'Favourites',
    'Contacts', and 'Pictures'. The rule aims to identify malicious behavior by correlating
    the loading of these DLLs from these unusual locations, which could indicate an
    attempt at DLL sideloading, a technique often used by attackers to execute arbitrary
    code.

  Summary: This rule detects the use of obfuscated PowerShell scripts that are executed
    via standard input (stdin). It specifically looks for patterns in the script block
    text that indicate the presence of obfuscation techniques, such as using the "set"
    command in combination with specific keywords like "environment," "invoke," or
    "$input". This can be a potential indicator of attempts to evade defenses or execute
    malicious commands. The rule relies on Script Block Logging being enabled to capture
    and analyze these patterns effectively. Potential false positives are unknown.

  Summary: This rule detects the use of the "reg.exe" utility to disable Protected
    Process Light (PPL) protection on the Local Security Authority (LSA) process on
    Windows systems. LSA is critical for managing local security policies and authentication,
    and disabling its PPL protection can expose the system to attacks. Specifically,
    this detection looks for instances where the "reg.exe" command is used to modify
    the "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" registry path with the intention of
    changing the "RunAsPPL" value to 0, thereby disabling PPL protection. This behavior
    is often associated with advanced persistent threat (APT) groups aiming to evade
    defenses.

  Summary: This rule detects the use of `bitsadmin` to download a file from a URL
    containing a direct IP address. Bitsadmin, a command-line tool in Windows, is
    often used for managing background file transfers. The method flags specific command-line
    options associated with Bitsadmin that signify a file download process, particularly
    using IP-listed URLs. The primary indicators involve certain command-line actions
    like `/transfer`, `/create`, and `/addfile`, which are typical of operations in
    downloading files. Additionally, certain URL patterns starting with numeric IP
    addresses are monitored while filtering out legitimate use cases like those related
    to 7-zip. This behavior is suspicious and may be used for evading defenses and
    establishing persistence.

  Summary: This rule detects Bitsadmin connections to domains with uncommon top-level
    domains (TLDs). Bitsadmin is a command-line tool that creates download or upload
    jobs and monitors their progress. The rule triggers when a user agent starting
    with 'Microsoft BITS/' makes a connection, and the target domain's TLD does not
    match common ones like .com, .net, .org, or known specialized domains. This is
    indicative of potential command-and-control communication, defense evasion, or
    persistence methods used in cyber attacks. However, it accounts for legitimate
    traffic, including updates from domains like Spotify and Microsoft's own domains.

    a ZIP file containing a malicious shortcut (LNK file). When a user opens the ZIP
    file using the Explorer process, it extracts the malicious content and deposits
    a shortcut leading to a backdoor into the Startup folder. The file name of the
    malicious shortcut includes a specific identifier `{0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}`,
    indicating a folder shortcut operation.

  Summary: This rule detects suspicious script executions from temporary folders on
    Windows systems. It monitors the creation of processes involving common scripting
    executables like `powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `wscript.exe`, and
    `cscript.exe` when they are executed from paths that include temporary directories
    such as `\Windows\Temp`, `AppData\Local\Temp`, or similar locations. The rule
    is designed to identify potentially malicious behavior common in attacks where
    scripts are executed from directories meant for temporary storage, which is often
    a tactic used to evade detection. Certain command line patterns generally associated
    with legitimate administrative or system processes, such as output redirection
    with `Out-File`, JSON conversion, or specific behaviors related to VSCode and
    AWS EC2, are filtered out to reduce false positives.

  Summary: This rule detects instances where privileged role assignments occur outside
    of Privileged Identity Management (PIM), which may signify a potential attack.
    Privileged Identity Management is a feature in Microsoft Azure that enables organizations
    to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources. The alert is triggered
    based on a specific risk event type, suggesting that the roles were assigned without
    adhering to the controlled guidelines of PIM, thus potentially leading to unauthorized
    privilege escalation.

  Summary: This rule detects an attacker creating deceptive folder structures resembling
    legitimate Windows system folders, such as "Windows" or "Program Files," but with
    an extra space. This tactic aims to exploit the DLL load search order and execute
    a "DLL Search Order Hijacking" attack, where a malicious DLL is loaded instead
    of a legitimate one. The focus is on monitoring file events in Windows, specifically
    targeting filenames that start with paths altered by an additional space and ending
    in ".dll".

  Summary: This rule detects potential XML External Entity (XXE) exploitation attempts
    in Java Virtual Machine (JVM) based applications. It focuses on identifying instances
    where XML parsing issues arise, as indicated by the presence of 'SAXParseException'
    or 'DOMException' in application error logs. These issues can potentially signify
    unsafe initialization of XML parsers, which could be exploited if not properly
    handled, posing initial access threats. It is essential to ensure proper parser
    initialization to mitigate this risk.

  Summary: This rule detects the execution of a renamed version of PAExec, which is
    often used by attackers for defense evasion. PAExec is a remote administration
    tool similar to PsExec and is sometimes renamed by legitimate users or attackers
    to obscure its presence. The detection criteria include specific file descriptions,
    original file names, product names, imphashes, and certain hash values. Additionally,
    there is a filter to exclude instances where PAExec is executed from its default
    directory or with filenames that start with a specific prefix, typical when used
    with the "-s" flag for system execution. False positives may include legitimate
    uses by system administrators or software companies that rename the tool.

  Summary: This rule detects the deletion of Shadow Copies using specific operating
    system utilities on Windows. It monitors the execution of processes such as powershell.exe,
    pwsh.exe, wmic.exe, vssadmin.exe, and diskshadow.exe, as well as wbadmin.exe.
    The rule identifies command line activities involving terms like "shadow," "delete,"
    "catalog," "quiet," "resize," "shadowstorage," "unbounded," and "/MaxSize=" to
    flag potentially malicious actions. These detections could indicate an attempt
    to interfere with system backups, often associated with ransomware activities.
    Legitimate use cases, such as administrative maintenance tasks, may also trigger
    this rule.

  Summary: This rule detects suspicious child processes originating from the Veeam
    service to identify potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) or SQL Injection attempts.
    It specifically monitors for processes created by the `sqlservr.exe` with the
    `VEEAMSQL` command line that spawn child processes such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`,
    `pwsh.exe`, `wsl.exe`, and `wt.exe`, particularly if their command lines contain
    suspicious keywords like '-ex', 'bypass', 'cscript', 'DownloadString', 'http://',
    'https://', 'mshta', 'regsvr32', 'rundll32', 'wscript', or 'copy'. Additionally,
    it looks for child processes like `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `nltest.exe`,
    `ping.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. Detecting these patterns suggests
    potential malicious activity within a Windows environment that involves Veeam
    services.

  Summary: This rule detects the execution of the "net use" command to mount a WebDAV
    server, followed by the immediate execution of content hosted on it, such as .exe,
    .dll, .bat, .vbs, or .ps1 files. This behavior might indicate the use of malicious
    LNK files, which are often employed in cyber attacks to execute remote code on
    a target system. The detection process monitors instances where the command prompt
    (cmd.exe) is used to establish a WebDAV connection and quickly run scripts or
    executables from the resulting share.

  Summary: This rule detects unexpected executable file writes on a Windows system
    by monitoring specific programs that typically should not perform such actions.
    It targets a list of executable files, including Microsoft Office programs (e.g.,
    eqnedt32.exe, wordpad.exe, wordview.exe), various legitimate binaries that can
    download executables (e.g., certutil.exe, CertReq.exe, mshta.exe), and other executables
    that should not drop files to disk like AcroRd32.exe and RdrCEF.exe. By focusing
    on these programs, the rule aims to identify potential misuse or malicious activities
    such as process injection or malware disguising as legitimate software when they
    write executable files with extensions like .exe, .dll, or .ocx to the disk.

  Summary: This rule detects the opening of ISO files within archiving software such
    as 7Zip, WinRAR, or PeaZip on Windows systems, a pattern often associated with
    phishing attacks. Threat actors commonly use small ISO files enclosed in archives
    as email attachments to circumvent security filters and protections. This behavior
    can be indicative of initial access tactics in cybersecurity threats, particularly
    aimed at evading detection mechanisms through the exploitation of archival software
    functionalities.
