  Summary: This rule detects an SQL Injection attempt in the Joomla com_jshop component.
    The attack is executed through a GET request to a specific URI that contains the
    parameters `option=com_jshop` and `&pid=` followed by an SQL `INSERT INTO` statement.
    This indicates an attempt to exploit a vulnerability associated with a known issue
    in Joomla, as documented in security references such as Bugtraq ID 36808 and a
    detailed exploit posted on Packet Storm Security.

  Summary: This rule detects activity associated with the Neosploit exploit pack by
    monitoring HTTP GET requests to external networks. It specifically looks for requests
    targeting URLs with particular file extensions such as PHP, ASP, PY, EXE, HTM,
    and HTML. The rule matches patterns indicative of Neosploit's obfuscated URLs
    in the request URI. Additionally, it checks for the presence of the "User-Agent"
    HTTP header while ensuring the "Referer" header is absent. Neosploit is known
    for delivering payloads through sophisticated URL structures, making this detection
    crucial for identifying potential exploit attempts in network traffic.
